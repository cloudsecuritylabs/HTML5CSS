            <p> Hello. I am Ankan Basu, a have been a GIS Data analyst, geochemist and hydrogeologist since 1997. I develop 3D geologic models and perform numerical analysis of groundwater flow. I am certified as a Professional Geologist (PG) in five states in the USA. I have a very diverse background and interest. Currently I am doing a degree in Engineering Computer Science and a second degree in Information Technology (IT). I am most interested in a career in software development for the desktop, web and mobile devices.    </p>

            <p>I started my journey in programming with Python, and now I have mastered JAVA, FORTRAN, C++, JavaScript, Visual Basic and R. I am an active learner at Coursera, Lynda and Edx and continuously learning more and more languages and concepts in programming every day. Currently I am devoting a lot of time learning interactive web applications using ASP.NET, Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. Welcome to my ePortfolio.</p>
            
            <p>I have worked very closely with engineers and have been using various engineering tools and software such as AutoCAD, SurvCAD, and Surfer for many years. </p>
            
            <p>
            I will be starting my career as a Software Engineer in the middle of November in Blacksburg, VA. I am very much thankful to all professors at New River Community College who taught me well and made me prepared for a challenging career in the software industry. I am very much excited about the new opportunity. I will still continue my education at NR.EDU and hope to learn more in the future.
            </p>
